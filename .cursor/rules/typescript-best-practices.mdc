- Enable strict mode in `tsconfig.json` for better type checking.
- Use type inference where possible to reduce redundancy.
- Implement generics for reusable components and functions.
- Use `readonly` for array and object properties to prevent unintended mutations.
- Utilize utility types like `Partial`, `Readonly`, and `Pick` for type manipulation.
