- Use R3F's declarative approach for creating Three.js scenes.
- Implement proper disposal of Three.js objects using `useEffect` cleanup.
- Utilize R3F's hooks like `useFrame` for animations and `useThree` for accessing the Three.js context.
- Optimize performance by using `useMemo` for expensive computations.
- Implement proper error handling for R3F components.
