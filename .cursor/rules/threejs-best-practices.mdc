- Organize Three.js components in `webgl/components/` for better project structure.
- Implement proper WebGL cleanup and disposal to prevent memory leaks.
- Use `useEffect` hooks for initialization and cleanup of Three.js objects.
- Optimize 3D scenes by reducing polygon counts and using level of detail (LOD).
- Implement proper error handling for WebGL operations.
